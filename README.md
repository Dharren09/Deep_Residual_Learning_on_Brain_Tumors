# Deep_Residual_Learning_on_Brain_Tumors
Implementing Deep Residual Learning from scratch on a Brain Tumor Classification problem using Tensorflow and Keras API, The sole purpose is to understand the core depth of Deep residual networks and how this fascinating ability for convolution networks to maintain a steady learning progress, increasing accuracy as more convolution layers added.
